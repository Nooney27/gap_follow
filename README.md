# Follow the Gap: Reactive method for Navigation

Implementation of the "Follow the Gap" algorithm using ROS 2. The algorithm enables a vehicle to navigate autonomously by detecting obstacles and driving towards the largest gap.
Features
- LiDAR Processing: Preprocesses LiDAR data to smooth and filter readings.
- Gap Detection: Identifies the largest gap in the field of view.
- Dynamic Speed: Adjusts speed based on the proximity of obstacles.
- Steering Control: Calculates optimal steering angles to navigate through gaps.
